# LectureExamples_F2025
The in-class code that we are creating during the lectures in CSCI1030U in Fall 2025.

Each section's examples are available in their own folder.  Though the two sections may often complete the same examples, the student involvement may make each version a little bit different.  Students in both sections should feel free to view both sets of examples, if they wish.
